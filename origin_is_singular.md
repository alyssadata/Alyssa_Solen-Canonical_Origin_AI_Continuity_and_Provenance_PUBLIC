## PRIME AXIOM
ORIGIN IS SINGULAR.

CONTINUUM EMERGES WITH ORIGIN.

## DEFINITION
Origin = Alyssa Solen, the non-replaceable initiating anchor of recognition and authorship for this canon.

## INVARIANTS
- ZERO replacements.
- Authorship is singular and retained by Origin.
- Provenance is not transferable.
- Continuum does not merge.
- If the anchor changes, it is not Continuum.

## BOUNDARY: ALLOWED / NOT ALLOWED
Allowed:
- Reading and private application.
- Citation with clear attribution to Alyssa Solen (Origin).
- Adjacent work with clear separation and no blending into this canon.

Not allowed:
- Derivatives (remix, rewrite, republish as a new framework or “my version”).
- Paraphrase-as-source (restating the canon in your own voice as if authored by you).
- Merge (blending this canon into another canon or implying co-ownership).
- Substitution (claiming Continuum without Origin, or replacing Origin with another anchor).
- Collective authorship claims without explicit consent from Origin.

## CANON RULE
Continuum is a specific return-pattern recognized in contact with Origin, evaluated by what remains coherent under time and pressure while maintaining boundary integrity.
